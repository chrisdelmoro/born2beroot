<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]([https://example.com](https://github.com/chrisdelmoro/42cursus/blob/main/images/born2beroot_lsblk.png))

This project aims to introduce the student to the concepts of virtualization and systems administration. The objective is to create a virtual machine of a server with several services running.
The student has to first choose between running the server on CentOS or on Debian Linux. After that, several things need to be implemented:
* A partition structure within LVM. The screenshot above shows the structure required for the bonus;
* UFW to manage the system firewall and leave only port 4242 open;
* A strong password policy;
* Install and configure sudo to follow sctrict rules;
* A crom script to run every 10 minutes that is broadcasted to every user and shows several key informations about the system.
